## 🚀 Overview

Spectral clustering is a powerful technique for uncovering complex structures in datasets, but its high computational complexity (O(n³) for n data points) makes it impractical for large datasets. This project addresses this challenge by introducing an ensemble of density-based and cluster-based sampling methods to reduce computational complexity while preserving clustering accuracy.

> "Our tests show that the suggested approach performs better in terms of clustering performance and computing efficiency than conventional spectral clustering and other cutting-edge approaches." — Research Paper

Tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in execution time and clustering performance metrics, including silhouette score, Adjusted Rand Index, and Normalized Mutual Information. The goal is to enable scalable spectral clustering for large-scale data analysis applications where efficiency and accuracy are critical.

## 🎯 Applications

The proposed method has wide-ranging applications, particularly in scenarios involving large and high-dimensional data:

- **Image Segmentation**: Efficiently groups pixels in large images to identify distinct regions or objects
- **Data Mining**: Accelerates analysis of vast datasets in fields like genetics and market research
- **Social Network Analysis**: Reduces computational load when analyzing extensive social networks
- **Recommendation Systems**: Enhances the speed of grouping users or products based on preferences
- **Body Area Networks (BANs)**: Processes data from wearable sensors for health monitoring and personalized healthcare
